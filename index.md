I'm an Assistant Professor in the <a href="https://computing.uga.edu/" target="_blank">School of Computing</a> and a faculty fellow at the <a href="https://www.ai.uga.edu/">Institute for Artificial Intelligence</a> at the University of Georgia. I'm also a <a href="https://ctl.uga.edu/faculty/faculty-fellows-programs/lilly-teaching-fellows/">Lilly Teaching Fellow</a>. 

<br />
<br />

My main research area is <strong>computer vision</strong>--understanding our world using visual data with the help of state-of-the-art deep learning models. In particular, I'm passionate about understanding people in diverse and complex environment using images and videos. I believe A.I. can and should be developed to improve people's quality of life. 

<br />
<br />

I am actively collaborating with researchers across disciplines to apply A.I. in scientific discovery, healthcare advancement, and societal challenges, aiming to create meaningful impact beyond traditional computer vision applications.

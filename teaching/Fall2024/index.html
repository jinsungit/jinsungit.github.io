<p>Advanced Representation Learning is a course designed to delve deeper into the fundamental concepts of representation learning and its applications. In this class, students will explore various representation learning techniques, including both classical and deep learning methods, and learn how to apply these techniques to solve complex problems in computer vision, natural language processing, audio, and other areas. By working on the research project component of the course, the students will develop novel methods and theories about representation learning and prepare manuscripts describing their findings. By the end of this course, the students will have a solid understanding of the state-of-the-art in representation learning and be able to apply these techniques to solve real-world problems.</p>
